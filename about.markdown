I'm a programming enthusiast based in Taipei, currently in batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). I like to think about algorithms, performance, and the social responsibilities of the software ecosystem. Check me out on [GitHub](https://github.com/dkmccandless) or email me for more info!
